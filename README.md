# About aste grf

[![aste grf discord server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/610091815236010015/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/r4Vp47G)

Game modification file for the Ragnarok Online mmorpg game created for NovaRo private server [NovaRo private server](https://www.novaragnarok.com/).

## General info

Main purpose of this grf was to create clear, performance friendly woe grf with a maximum readability, so even people who only starting playing woe can have a clear understanding what is happening around them.
Even though it’s a woe grf at the first place, it’s still fully playable for pvm.

## Compiling the grf

- Download [tokei's grf editor](https://rathena.org/board/topic/77080-grf-grf-editor/).
- Put every file in the grf container using tokei's grf editor, starting tree structure from **data/..** so the end result would look like **grf/data/...**
- Put grf file in the your client folder **usually (C:\Program Files (x86)\NovaRO)**.
- Open your **data.ini** file with any text editor tool (notepad for example). Add a new line after jobsprites.grf and before maps.grf with a number 3 in it. Change all numbers in the list so files would be numbered from 0 to 8. Save.

## MH2 Graymap

Due to the encryption of mh2 graymap it can't be shared here in github, but if you still want to have it, you can use this clear grf with encrypted mh2 map as a base and build your own version of grf upon it [aste-grf-mh2-clear-base](https://github.com/asteanya/grf/releases/download/v2/aste-grf-mh2-clear-base.grf).
